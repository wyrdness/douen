      "summary": "The spirits of unbaptized children in Trinidad and Tobago folklore, appearing as small children with backwards-pointing feet, wearing large straw hats, who lure living children deep into the forest to become lost.",
      "full": "Douens are among the most poignant and complex figures in Trinidad and Tobago folklore—the spirits of children who died before baptism, condemned to wander the forests eternally. They appear as small children, often around 3-8 years old, wearing oversized straw hats that hide their faces. Their most distinctive feature is feet that point backwards, making their tracks impossible to follow correctly. Douens call to living children in high, childlike voices, inviting them to play, and lead them deeper into the forest where they become hopelessly lost. The legend reflects a powerful synthesis of Catholic baptism theology, African ancestral spirit beliefs, and the very real dangers of child mortality and forest environments. Douens embody the tragedy of children who died outside the Church's grace, the fear of losing children to the wilderness, and cultural anxieties about proper spiritual protection through baptism. Unlike purely malevolent spirits, Douens occupy an ambiguous moral space—neither fully evil nor innocent, driven by loneliness and the desire for companionship rather than pure malice."
